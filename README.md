# 📝 To-Do List Application (Java Swing)

## 📌 Overview
This is my solution for **Task 6: Java GUI – ToDo App** given in the Java Developer Internship.  
It is a **desktop-based GUI CRUD system** to manage daily tasks using **Java Swing**.

## ✅ What I Have Done
- Created a **Java Swing GUI** using `JFrame`, `JPanel`, `JTextField`, `JButton`, `JList`.
- Used **DefaultListModel & JList** to dynamically store and display tasks.
- Added **"Add Task"** button to insert tasks from user input.
- Added **"Delete Task"** button to remove selected tasks.
- Implemented **event handling (ActionListener)** for button clicks.
- Added **input validation** (empty tasks are not allowed).
- Used **JOptionPane dialogs** for error handling.
- Wrote a **README.md** to explain project structure and usage.
